Several of the theories we have looked at thus far purport to discover strangers hidden somewhere in the prehistory of the Jews. In Freudâ€™s case, as we noted in the last chapter, the foreigner in the background was an Egyptian, Akhenaten, who transferred certain elements of his religious reform to the Jews through the medium of his follower Moses. 
Others ascribed a seminal role to the Babylonian or Persian culture that the Jews encountered at the end of the biblical period or during their exile. 
What connects all these theories is their conception of the Jews or Judaism as a hybrid that can be traced back not just to the Israelites of the biblical era but also to another people, religion, or culture.
